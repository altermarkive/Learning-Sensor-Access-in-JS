Simplified-HTML5-Canvas-Animation
=================================

As it turns out a frame-by-frame animation of HTML5 Canvas is still somewhat browser-dependent. To make it easier for me to make simple animations I created a small JavaScript library:

[ua.js](ua.js)

It's very easy to use - here's an example:

[index.html](index.html)

Note that in the example I also made sure to have the canvas fill the browser's window fully and without scrollbars appearing.

See the example in action [here](https://altermarkive.github.io/Simplified-HTML5-Canvas-Animation/).
