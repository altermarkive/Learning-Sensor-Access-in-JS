<!--
This HTML file with JavaScript embedded code demonstrates how to call
the Emscripten-generated code (and pass a JavaScript callback function to it).
The code creates a function pointer for the callback function (the callback
function accesses via its pointer the string passed by the Emscripten-generated
code). Then, a JavaScript wrapper function for the Emscripten-generated code
is created and called. Finally, the function pointer is destroyed.
